# Clients

## Sedaro OpenAPI Client Generator

An interactive tool for building clients for Sedaro Satellite based on our OpenAPI spec. Built on an **OpenAPI Generator** docker image: https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation#docker

If you are generating a client based on the dev open api spec, make sure the open api docker container is running. If you want to make it based on the live spec, upload the `DOWNLOAD_SPEC_FROM` accordingly variable in `__main__.py`.

Make sure current python version is >=3.8. In the directory containing this directory run:

- `$ python3 client_generator`

You will be prompted on how to proceed.

_Note: requires python to be installed on the computer or a virtual environment to be created in the directory._

## Known Issues:

First:

- Issue: The schema generated by FastAPI has problems with generating the spec when a tuple is involved, may be related to this [thread](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/3782) (may be solved if update FastAPI).

- Temporary Workaround: comment out `powerCommand` property on `SolarArray` when running the client generator.

Second:

- Issue: The classes that the Open API Generator creates don't like it when `None` is passed for some Optional properties that have a specific type.
- Temporary Workaround: comment out `beta`,`orbitalElements`, `missionOrbit`, and `shadow` on `VehicleTemplate` when running the client generator.
